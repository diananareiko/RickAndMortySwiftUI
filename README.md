SwiftUI MVVM Clean Architecture Demo

This project was created as a demonstration of how to build an app using SwiftUI based on the MVVM architecture.
It also showcases the implementation of a Coordinator using NavigationDestination and NavigationPath.
Additionally, it demonstrates a method for creating Dependency Injection (DI) with the help of a PropertyWrapper.

MVVM (Model View ViewModel) is an architectural pattern based on MVC and MVP, which attempts to more clearly separate the development of user-interfaces (UI) from that of the business logic and behaviour in an application.
